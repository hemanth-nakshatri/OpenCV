A few simple OpenCV  projects like Face detector, Number Plate detector, Paper warp perspective, and virtual light pen.

### Cascades
The haar cascade used for face detection and number plate detection can be found here. [https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades].
The one used for face detection is "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" and "haarcascade_russian_plate_number.xml" for number plate detection.
